# KeePass Master Password Cracker

## Overview

This Python script is an exploit designed to automate the process of exploiting the security vulnerability `CVE-2023-32784`. The script aims to crack the master passwords of KeePass databases (`.kdbx` files) using partial password dumps from `.DMP` files. It attempts to find the correct password by iterating through a charset for the first character of the password and appending it to the rest of the password parts obtained from the `.DMP` file. Successful password discoveries are recorded in a `.potfile`.

## Features

- Reads `.kdbx` and `.DMP` files from a specified directory.
- Iterates through possible passwords by substituting the first character with every character in a predefined charset.
- Attempts to log into each `.kdbx` file using the generated passwords.
- Records successfully cracked passwords in a `.potfile`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- pykeepass 4.0.7
- Access to a directory containing .kdbx and .DMP files
- A working environment for running .NET or other password extraction tools

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JohnTwiiX/dso-python-tasks.git
    cd exploit
    ```

2. Install Dependencies:

    Ensure you have pykeepass installed. You can install it via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pykeepass
    ```

3. Prepare the Dump Tool:

    This script assumes a tool located in ./keepass-dump-masterkey.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Place Your Files:

    - Ensure your .kdbx and .DMP files are in a directory, e.g., ./data.

2. Run the Script:

    ```bash
    python3 exploit.py -dir ./data
    ```

    Replace ./data with the path to your directory containing the files.

3. Review the Results:

    The successfully cracked passwords will be saved in a `.potfile` in the specified directory.

## Troubleshooting

- Error: `Dictionary not found!`

  - Ensure that the specified directory contains `.kdbx` and `.DMP` files.

- Error: `Keepass Password Dumper program closed.`

  - Ensure that the password dumper script or tool is working correctly and accessible in the specified directory.
  - there are no passwords
